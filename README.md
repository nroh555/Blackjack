# Blackjack

Created a AI based Blackjack game whereby there will be 4 players. The players are yourself, 2 AI bots and a dealer. I implemented the different strategies for the dealer and the AI bots using the Strategy and Factory design patterns in Java. Performed unit testing using JUnit testing framework. Below are some images of the game as output to the console.
